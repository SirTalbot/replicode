// Atomic state controller. Attached to a null-pgm and monitoring to a (repeated) input fact (SYNC_PERIODIC or SYNC_HOLD).
// Has a resilience of 2 times the upr of the group its target comes from.
// Upon catching a counter-evidence, signal the TPX and kill the object (i.e. invalidate and kill views); this will kill the controller and TPX.
// Catching a predicted evidence means that there is a model that predicts the next value of the object: kill the CTPX.
// AST live in primary groups and take their inputs therefrom: these are filtered by the A/F WRT goals/predictions.
// There is no control over AST: instead, computation is minimal (just pattern-matching) and CTPX are killed asap whenever a model predicts a value change.
// There cannot be any control based on the semantics of the inputs as these are atomic and henceforth no icst is available at injection time.
